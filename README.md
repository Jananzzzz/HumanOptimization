# Human Body Optimization

> Optimize our body is always a hot topic, and we definitely believe that human body can be optimized by scientific and systematic nursing. And this is a projuect for better our body and improve our life quality. Hope everyone can lives to be 150! 

**For body optimization, we mainly focus on the following parts:**
- Rest
- Diet
- Exercise
- Work

**Now let's begin!**
## Rest
Rest is undoubtedly the most important part of our physical activity. (And in my opinion it is also the most amazing activity of human beings. In fact, we almost know nothing about sleep.)
