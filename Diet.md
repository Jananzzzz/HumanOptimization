# Diet

**Less is more.**
- Less carbon. 
- Less Deeply processed food.

**Careful with more.**
- More vegetable.
- More water, milk, tea, coffee, all kinds of sugar-free drinks.

**Fasting**
- Eating window is between 12:00 pm and 5pm, which can be slightly extended. Not eating in the late evening.
- It is totally okay to skip the so-call "breakfast" which usually in the morning. In fact, breakfast is just "break" the fast, so the first meal you eat after fasting is breakfast.
- During eating and digestion, our body cells absorbs nutrients to grow and reproduce; during fasting, our body cells repair and clean up. It is necessary to give our body enough "hungry" time to clean and rebuild our body.
