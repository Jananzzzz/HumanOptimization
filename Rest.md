# Rest Is The First
> I am confident that I know little about this part, cause rest is a very very mysterious part in our brain activity. Myself don't have a efficient and stable rest method.


## Sleep
Night sleep is the most important part of rest. Here are some poiont to discuss:
- How long should we sleep?
- When should we sleep?
- Sleep enough at one time, or sleep in multiple stages? 

### How long should we sleep?


### Don't use a alarm

## Nap
For many people, nap is an indispensible part of daytime. If they do not gap during the work gap, they will feel tired and their concentration will decrease. But for others, nap seems unnecessary.

Benefits of napping:
- Relaxtion
- Reduced fatigue
- Increased alertness
- Improved mood
- Improved performance, including quicker reaction time and better memory

Possible drawbacks of napping:
- **Sleep inertia.** You might feel groggy and disoriented after waiting up from a nap.
- **Nighttime sleep problems**. Short naps generally won't affect nighttime sleep quality for most people. But if you experience insomnia or poor sleep quality at night, napping night worsen this problems. Long or frequent naps might interfere with nighttime sleep.

From my experience, napping after a long work session will be fine. For example, a nap after 4 hours of deep work in the morning will refresh you for afternoon work. Similarly, you can also take a nap after 4 hours of afternoon work, **if and only if** you still have a certain intensity of work at night. For most people, a nap at noon is enough, and up to two naps per day.

How to take a nap? Here are some point:
- **Create a restful environment.** Nap in a quiet, dark place with a commfortable room and temperature and few distractions. If your nap is interrupted, it may affect your mood and the next work.
- **Take naps early in the day.** As said before, if you don't too much work at night, I recommand take a nap at noon, no later than 3 pm. Otherwise, it may affect your night sleep.
- **Keep naps short.** Aim to nap for only 10 to 30 minutes. The longer you nap, the more likely you are to feel groggy afterward. A nap of more than an hour is likey to affect your sleep at night.
