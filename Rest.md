# Rest Is The First
> I am confident that I know little about this part, cause rest is a very very mysterious part in our brain activity. Myself don't have a efficient and stable rest method.

## Sleep
Night sleep is the most important part of rest. Here are some point to discuss:
- How long should we sleep?
- When should we sleep?
- Sleep enough at one time, or sleep in multiple stages? 

### How long should we sleep?
A sleep of 6 to 9 hour is OK. Of course, it is not ruled out that some people can keep energetic even if they only sleep for five hours. (But for most people, to avoid the possibility of overdraft, sleep at least 6 hours.) For the small group of people who sleep for 10 hours, I have to say that, it is acceptable only if you are under 18. (Young people need more sleep.) Have a physical examination if necessary.

### When should you sleep?
- School-age children should go to bed between 8:00 and 9:00 p.m.
- Teens should try to go to bed between 9:00 and 10:00 p.m.
- Adults should try to go to sleep between 10:00 and 11:00 p.m.

The window of sleeping is roughly between 8 PM and 12 AM, during which our brain and body have the opportunity to get all the non-REM and REM shuteye they need to function optimally.

### Don't use a alarm
Our sleep time is not fixed. For example, if you worked too hard the day before, you may need more sleep.
So, to full charge our body by sleeping, don't let alarm interrupt your sleep. Remember that rest is the most important thing!

### Can't fall asleep?
Here are some points you can do:
- Sleep at a fixed time (as said before)
- Don't do anything in bed except sleep, especially don't use your cell phone lying down. (It will make your brain think that the bed is not a place for sleep.)
- Play a podcast (set a time sleeper) at bedside when you sleep. (Extremely useful!)

### For programmers*

As we all know, programmers are all night owls &#128514;.If you are a programmer like me, there are still something to say.

I want to ask for programmers: Is it okay to sleep late at night, for example 1 a.m.?

The answer is **YES**, but not recommanded.

**Why I say yes?** Because people's work and rest will change according to the environment. Programmers work at night, they absorbed a lot of light before going to bed from lamp, monitor, etc. Light will dalay our sleeping time (It's better to not to be exposed to too much light an hour before going to bed.) Our body automatically adapt to this process. So, if you work before a monitor at night, it is totally ok to put off your sleep. 1 a.m. is acceptable as long as you feel well. Also, if you sleep late at night, you will also get up late the next day morning. It will make you easy to fast till noon.

**Why I say not recommanded?** Because many people don't have a habit of go to bed late at night, they just sleep late at weekend, or when they not work efficiently at daytime. If you are one of the above two situations, you'd better not stay up late. Habit is important, our body remember our habit. If you are used to sleep late, just keep it. 

Another reason why I not recommand sleep late is that if you sleep at 2 AM, you might wake up at 10 AM. Then you will lose you morning time. (Just a personal opinion, morning time is very important. I enjoy completing some tasks in the morning, then I will be happy all day.)

## Nap
For many people, nap is an indispensible part of daytime. If they do not gap during the work gap, they will feel tired and their concentration will decrease. But for others, nap seems unnecessary.

Benefits of napping:
- Relaxtion
- Reduced fatigue
- Increased alertness
- Improved mood
- Improved performance, including quicker reaction time and better memory

Possible drawbacks of napping:
- **Sleep inertia.** You might feel groggy and disoriented after waiting up from a nap.
- **Nighttime sleep problems**. Short naps generally won't affect nighttime sleep quality for most people. But if you experience insomnia or poor sleep quality at night, napping night worsen this problems. Long or frequent naps might interfere with nighttime sleep.

From my experience, napping after a long work session will be fine. For example, a nap after 4 hours of deep work in the morning will refresh you for afternoon work. Similarly, you can also take a nap after 4 hours of afternoon work, **if and only if** you still have a certain intensity of work at night. For most people, a nap at noon is enough, and up to two naps per day.

How to take a nap? Here are some point:
- **Create a restful environment.** Nap in a quiet, dark place with a commfortable room and temperature and few distractions. If your nap is interrupted, it may affect your mood and the next work.
- **Take naps early in the day.** As said before, if you don't too much work at night, I recommand take a nap at noon, no later than 3 pm. Otherwise, it may affect your night sleep.
- **Keep naps short.** Aim to nap for only 10 to 30 minutes. The longer you nap, the more likely you are to feel groggy afterward. A nap of more than an hour is likey to affect your sleep at night.

## Body and mind
Obviously, we should look at the rest of body and brain separately. When we sleep, we rest them both. 

But what if your body is tired but your brain is still highly active? Should we go to bed in under this circumstance?

My advice is if you feel tired (for example after a long run) but your mind is active, and it's not normal sleep time, then don't try to sleep. You can just sit or lie on the sofa, eat something, listen to music, just do something relaxing. If you let yourself sleep at this time, it is likely to disrupt your normal sleep rhythm.

In fact, in most cases, the degree of fatigue of the brain and body is different. To better our sleep, brain workers can do some exercise between jobs, stand while coding, and manual worker can read some books before sleep, etc.

## Outside
Surroud yourself with nature for ample time, which will give your brain a quicker rest and potentially give you inspiration.

Walking outside is the best way to think and rest your mind.
