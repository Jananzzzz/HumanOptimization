# Exercise or not, that is a question

Exercise is the most controversial part of human body optimization. Even whether exercise is beneficial if full of controversial. All words in this part are paltry advice. Every should try to exercise to find their own way.

The following will start from my personal experience:

> I don't exercise currently, but I exercised a lot in the past. Before, my daily exercise plan is:
> - Running 10 kms
> - Pull up 5 groups, 5 for each group
> - Sit up 3 groups, 30 for each group
> - Push up 3 groups, 20, 15 and 10 for each group

> These exercise will take about one and a half hour to finish. I usually start exercise at 5 p.m. and with an empty stomach.

> The effect of exercise was significant: My weight dropped quickly, I felt as light as a swallow, vigorous, energetic. I can easily sit 20 pull ups at a time, or run 5 kilometers in 20 minutes. It was amazing.

> And The most important part is psychological: The confidence that exercise brings to me and the pure happiness that dopamine releases during exercise are the real meaning of exercise.

> Exercising is really a cool thing.

And why did i give up exercising finally? Let me continue.

> Later, I travelled to a coastal city for about a month. During that time, I did not keep exercising, Then it was winter, and i was going to continue my exercise like before. But when I tried to running 10 km again, I felt wrong: I did not run as easily as before, but very hard. After running for two laps, I was out of breath. Only two month passed, my running level dropped quickly.

> I started questioning myself: what was the meaning of my running before?

> I realized that exercise is an activity that you must keep throwing your energy into. You just can't stop. 

> **That is, exercise is meaningful and beneficial only if you persist in it, and the process of persistence is enjoyment. Once you stop exercising, your body will gradually return to the state before you start exercising, and all the exercises in the past become worthless.**

> That was my experience.

The essence of exercise is to let us get out of our usual comfort zone. But comfort itself is not a bad thing. 

Exercise itself is painful and against human nature. Think about it: When you walk out of your warm room, the cold wind outside is bitting your bones, and you have to run around the playground for more than a dozen times, what is your purpose of exercising? 

For happiness? No, because when you walk into the cold wnd and start exercising, feel tired again and again, in fact, you are in pain.

For a strong body? No, because when you stop exercising, your body will gradually adapt to daily life instead of strenuous exercise. Finally, your body will become the same before you exercise. 

Again, **exercise is only beneficial and meaningful when you keep doing it.**

### A personal view
To sum up, here are the points why I have a doubt on the necessity of exercise:
- Whether exercise will accelerate or dalay aging remains controversial. 
- Exercise is a long process. If give up, all the exercises in the past will be worthless.
- Exercise is against human nature. It pulls us out of our normal life. It make you feel tired, may even affect your study or work.
- Exercise takes us a lot of time. An hour of exercise may lead to time spent on preparing equipments, commuting and taking a bath and rest after exercise.

It seems that I am making excuses for not exercising. But in my heart, for most people I met, I don't recommand them to exercise. Still, exercise cost energy and time, and may end up in no gain.

I know many people, especially brainer worker like my professor and teacher, who never exercise, still in good health state and live to 90s. This makes me further question the role of exercise in our life.

### For those who want to exercise

For those want to strengthen their body, have the will to keep exercise for life time, and have much time for exercising, I still have some advice for you, as an experienced person:
- Keep exercising. Just keep it, without break. If it rains, you can exercise indoor. If you hurt your leg, you can exercise your arm. Persistence is the most important and also the most difficult part of exercising. 
- Not exercising too much. Though there is no evidence that exercising can extend our life span, but it is known that exercising too much will accelerating our body aging, even hurt your body.
- Exercising with a friend or group, if possible. Others company helps you go further.
- Buy some professional sports equipment if affordable. They will help you exercise more scientifically and effectively, and make you more confident.

The benefits of exercise are very obvious:
- Strengthen your body.
- Build your body and make you attractive.
- Make you feel confident in doing everything.


#### Tips for exercising:
- Exercise in the morning and night are both okay, depending on your personal habits.
- You can exercise in the morning with or withour breakfast. Without breakfast, you can lose weight more easily. Aerobic exercise on a empty stomach is the most effective way to reduce fat and weight.
- If you exercise at night, at least three hours before bed. Otherwise it may affect your sleep.

**Hope you enjoy exercising!**
