# Work Is Art

## Think Twice 

## Concentration
Most People can only keep their focus for less than ten minutes when working on boring or uninteresing jobs. We can extend our focus time by exercising foucus or making work interesting.

To exercise, [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) is a good method:
- Work for 25 minutes
- Small break for 5 minutes
- Repeat the above two steps, and take a big break of 25 minutes every fourth cycle

For beginner, 25 minutes focus maybe too long, so we can satart with 10 minutes, then 15 minutes, finally come to 25 minutes. But it is not recommand to over half an hour, because our concentration will gradually lose over time during the work. The longer you work at a time, the less productive you are. Regular breaks are necessary and beneficial.
