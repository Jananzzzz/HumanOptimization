# Work Is Art

## Think Twice 
- **Understand your work.** 

    Before start your work, you should first know what you really need to do. The more you understand your work, the better you will do it.
    
    To better understand your work, think about:
    - **Why you need to do this work?** (goals, importance, urgency) From my personal experience, many jobs are useless, just on the spur of the moment. And if you don't understand the importance or urgency of your work, the energy you throw into maybe inproportional to the importance of the work. 
    - **What are you going to complete?** (what are the tasks in this work, what will you get from the work, what is the final result)
    - **Steps to complete your work.** (figure out what method, knowledge base, technology stack you need, the basic route map)

- **Make a plan and Evaluation**
    
    After understanding your work, you can make a plan with evaluation:
    - Draw a architecture diagram of your work, on the paper, Xmind, or just in your mind.
    - Make evaluation of the difficulty, the breadth of knowledge and time required of your work.(It can be accurate to every step.)
    - Formulate a reasonable plan and schedule.

## Concentration
Most People can only keep their focus for less than ten minutes when working on boring or uninteresing jobs. We can extend our focus time by exercising foucus or making work interesting.

To exercise, [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) is a good method:
- Work for 25 minutes
- Small break for 5 minutes
- Repeat the above two steps, and take a big break of 25 minutes every fourth cycle

For beginner, 25 minutes focus maybe too long, so we can satart with 10 minutes, then 15 minutes, finally come to 25 minutes. But it is not recommand to over half an hour, because our concentration will gradually lose over time during the work. The longer you work at a time, the less productive you are. Regular breaks are necessary and beneficial.

### Some tips for keep concentration:
- Away from your phone or keep screen facing down
- Quit all social software on the computer
- Do one thing at a time
- Interest is the trump card to stay focused
- Understand the structure of your work, then start doing

## Tips & Techniques
- **Prevent Procrastination.** The moment you get you job, you should *think twice*. Make plans for your job. Tasks that must be completed should be completed as soon as possible.
- If something is not urgent but is likely to take a lot of time to complete, just put it aside. Later, you may find easy ways to deal with it, or just find it not important. 
- **Talk less.** Talk much, err much. Talk less means think more and improve the information entropy of your speaking. Less nonsense and meaningless words.
